### Titlu

    3D Real-time Face Acupoints Recognition System Based on HoloLens 2
### Aplicatie/Domeniu 

    Traditional Chinese Medicine

### Tehnologii utilizate 
    
    Microsoft HoloLens2

### Metodologie 

    Firstly, face detection is performed on the grayscale image generated by 
    data processing thread. When the face is detected, the landmark detection
    algorithm is used to extract the facial feature points. Then the extracted
    facial features are combined with the acupoints location method to realize 
    the location of 2D acupoints. The 2D acupoints combined with depth image 
    generated by data processing thread is transformed into 3D acupoints and 
    filtered. Finally, the visualization of acupoints is realized on HoloLens 2 
### Rezultate 
    
    the visualization of acupoints
### Limitari 
    
    The positioning error of the system is about 2.55 mm and
    the frame rate is 20.59 FPS.

    Research on Object Detection based on HoloLens2
### Aplicatie/Domeniu 
    
    Research of image recognition
### Tehnologii utilizate 
    
    HARDWARE: Microsoft HoloLens2 
    SOFTWARE: Yolo-v4 
### Metodologie
    
    the usage of detection algorithm YOLO-v4 (Yolo algorithm is 
    a typical single-step algorithm, known to be fast, and compared 
    to other algorithms, the framework is simple and versatile. 
    The network structure of YOLO-v4 mainly includes the following 
    parts: input, backbone , algorithm and neck.)

### Rezultate
    
    HoloLens based object detection
### Limitari 
    
    not effective enough for the detection of occluded or
    overlapping objects and small target objects

    Developing a wearable Augmented Reality for treating phantom limb 
    pain using the Microsoft Hololens 2
### Aplicatie/Domeniu 

    medicine
### Tehnologii utilizate 
    
    Microsoft HoloLens2, mirrors
### Metodologie 
    
    To alleviate this pain, patients engage in mirror therapy during 
    which a mirror is placed in front of the patient’s midsection, and 
    the patient, while looking into this mirror, imagines that the 
    amputated limb is in fact the healthy limb reflected in the mirror.
### Rezultate 
    
    the dissapearance of phantom limb pain, without a therapist being present
### Limitari 
    
    dependence on HoloLens2

    Using Object Recognition on HOLOLENS 2 for Assembly
### Aplicatie/Domeniu 
    
    This paper looks into how new innovative applications using 
    Microsoft HoloLens 2 can be used with Azure Custom Vision services on
    assembly tasks.
### Tehnologii utilizate
    
    Software: AZURE CUSTOM VISION
    Hardware: Microsoft Hololens2
### Metodologie 
    
    In an AR scenario, virtual 3D models, are used to convey assembly 
    instructions. Two physical parts of the assembly were tracked, thus 
    aligning natural objects with virtual objects, such as a video
    displaying instructions.
### Rezultate 
    
    The model gave above an 80% match score for objects even when the
    objects were placed in different environments. The model also had false
    positives towards objects that were a similar shape as a RAM stick and
    a motherboard.
### Limitari 
    
    in HoloLens 2 the FoV is almost doubled to 52°, offering a more
    immersive experience for the user. The effective resolution has increased
    from 720p per eye to 2K display per eye, but the density of the images
    is still the same, which is at 47 pixels per degree. However, there is still
    one more issue to solve – HoloLens’ vertical field of view. Even with the
    HoloLens 2, when looking up the user loses part of the image from above.

### Titlu 
    
    Small Object Detection for Near Real-Time Egocentric Perception in a
    Manual Assembly Scenario
### Aplicatie/Domeniu 
    
    For assisting workers in manual assembly.
### Tehnologii utilizate 

    Software: YOLOv4
    Hardware: Microsoft Hololens2

### Metodologie 
    
    We generate a training data set based on CAD data and realistic 
    backgrounds in Unity. We then train a YOLOv4 model for a two-stage 
    detection process: First, the context is recognized, then the small 
    object of interest is detected.
### Rezultate 
    
    The larger dataset and the wider diversity of data assists the trained 
    model to generalise to the new unseen test dataset. For IoU = 10% the mAP 
    reaches 70%. This means that hierarchical detection improves the detection 
    of small objects. This pipeline runs at 9.4fps, which is considered near 
    real-time.
### Limitari 
    
    the pipeline runs at 9.4fps.
